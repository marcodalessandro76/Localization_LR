\title{Critical assessment of Linear-Response Excitations in Molecular system\\
or \\
On the Localization of the Linear-Response excitations in Open Systems}
\author{You}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
By performing linear-response (LR)-TDDFT calculation of molecular systems within a highly complete real-space basis set, we analyse how the behaviour of the dynamical polarizability is influenced by
the discretization conditions of the computational treatment.
We show that optical excitations of energy below the LR ionization potential behave as observable, localized quantities, that can be studied with high precision, provided an adequate level of completeness.
We then present indicators that can help to quantify such potential observable property of an excitation, that can be evaluated in any discretization scheme.
Under this light, we also show that 
excitation energies above ionization threshold do not exhibit such observable features and \emph{cannot} be considered as poles of the dynamical polarizability.
This result is a inherent behaviour of the system's Liouvillian, and does not depend on computational treatment of the unoccupied subspace.
\end{abstract}

\section{Reboot with recent considerations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Write the excitations as the eigenstates of the Liouvillian:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Casida Matrix provides the eigenvectors in the basis of the unperturbed transitions
\item From the Casida eigenproblem we 
get the poles of the dynamical polarizability and we may reconstruct the perturbed wavefunctions
\item Lot of solution in state of 
the art to express \emph{the same information}, still by avoiding the explicit diagonalization of the problem
\end{itemize}
\item Such transitions might also be written in terms of the solutions of the eigenproblem for the perturbed hamiltonian
\begin{itemize}
\item There are therefore excitations which correspond to localized solutions of the above eigenproblems
\item There is a \emph{energy threshold} above which the eigenfunction associated \emph{cannot be anymore} localized
\end{itemize}
\item Below threshold, the eigenfunction are localized and the energy values are \emph{observable} quantities (there is a convergence in terms of the simulation parameters)
\begin{itemize}
\item Casida treatments for different
basis sets exhibit convergence of the low-energy excitations
\item Still, even for such localized excitations, non-trivial dependence on the empty states on some of excitation value is observed (energies converge relatively slowly wrt $N_\alpha$)
\item The locality of the excitation can be \emph{measured}
{\bf NEW idea for the SoB: why not to consider}
$$
\int \mathrm d \mathbf r
\rho(\mathbf r) |\phi_p^E(\mathbf r)|^2
$$
or similar quantities, that are independent on the number of empty and  bound states
\item Localized Excitation are the  only one with an observable character (this is surely already known)
\item The spectrum of the Loiuvillian in this regime is a \emph{discrete} spectrum; the excitation energies are \emph{poles} of the dynamical polarizability
nano\item We may associate the value of the threshold to the \emph{ionization potential}: This is a very intersting remark in my opinion: the physics of the optical excitation is observable 
(and therefore localized) only if the energies are not higher than the energy needed to ionize the system. After this point, it seems normal to me that the ``optical'' excitations with real value of the energy are not  meant to be observable anymore.
\item Optical Excitations below threshold have therefore a (very) long lifetime (poles on the real axis), and they contribute to the analytic structure of the dynamical polarizability.
\end{itemize}
\item Above this threshold the energies have a strong dependence on the computational treatment
\begin{itemize}
\item The high-energy part of the 
spectrum does not converge with the 
boundary conditions, even though they converge wrt the empty states (established techniques \emph{do not solve} such problem)
\item This is \emph{not} a problem that is related to the continuum collapse of the empty states.
\item They belong to the continuum of  the Liouvillian $\rightarrow$ they collapse, or depend strongly on the basis set adopted
\item They cannot be considered separately \emph{even when they are expressed in localized basis} as 
their shape is dependent on the treatment
\item They energies are not \emph{true} poles of the dynamical polarizability (the spectra converge only by superposition of deltas)
\end{itemize}
\item Optical excitation above Ionization threshold are therefore observable \emph{only} if they possess a lifetime (the peaks of the spectrum have a well-defined broadening). In this way they might be expressed in terms of resonant wavefunctions
\end{itemize}

\section{THEORY}

\subsection{Basic definitions}

We consider a generic one-body quantum mechanical problem described by the hermitian Hamiltonian $\hnot$  written in terms of the standard 
kinetic operator $\op T$ plus a one-body potential $\op V$, which we assume to be completely general, i.e. possibly nonlocal.
We consider open systems, so that $\hnot$ is defined on $\mathbb L_2(\mathbb R_3)$ and the basis of its eigenfunctions spans this 
functional space. Therefore, together with the discrete part of its spectrum $\epsilon_p$, the Hamiltonian may have an essential spectrum 
$\epsilon(\alpha)$, parametrized by the continuum label $\alpha$. 

A generic state $\ket{f} \in \mathbb L_2(\mathbb R_3)$ can be expanded in the basis of the eigenstates of $\hnot$, that is:
\be\lb{ketBasisExpDef1}
\ket{f} = \sum_p f_p \ket{\psi_p} + \int \dd \alpha f(\alpha) \ket{\psi(\alpha)}  = 
\sint \dd s f(s) \ket{\psi(s)} \;,
\ee
where we have introduced the compact multi-index $s$ that collect both the discrete and continuum part of the spectrum of $\hnot$.
The normalization of the basis can be chosen so that the standard orthonormality condition holds, that is: 
\be
\brket{\psi(s)}{\psi(s')} = \delta(s-s') \;,
\ee
and the completeness condition is written as:
\be\lb{completenessH0basis1}
\identity = \sint \dd s \ketbra{\psi(s)}{\psi(s)} = \sum_{p} \ketbra{\psi_p}{\psi_p} + \int \dd\alpha \ketbra{\psi(\alpha)}{\psi(\alpha)} \;. 
\ee
Thanks to this condition the coefficients of the expansion \eqref{ketBasisExpDef1} can be expressed via a scalar products, namely $f_{p} = 
\brket{\psi_p}{f}$ and $f(\alpha) = \brket{\psi(\alpha)}{f}$.

\subsection{Time evolution of states in the linear response regime}

We discuss the time evolution of a generic state vector in the case in which a hermitian time dependent perturbation $\hone{t}$ is added to $\hnot$. 
To achieve this task we have to solve the time dependent Schroedinger equation supplied by the knowledge of the state at the ``initial'' time $t_0$.
We seek for a solution of the form:
\be\lb{ketTimeEvol1}
\ket{\psi(t_{0},t)} = e^{-\ii \hnot t} \op{U}_{I}(t,t_0) e^{\ii \hnot t_0}\ket{\psi_0} \; . 
\ee
where $\op{U}_I(t,t_0)$ is the time evolution operator induced by $\hone{}$ that satisfies the ``initial'' time condition $\op{U}_I(t_0,t_0)=1$. 
Plugging the expression \eqref{ketTimeEvol1} in the Schroedinger equation we obtain a differential equation for $\op{U}_I$ that can be solved 
iteratively as a power series in $\hone{}$. Limiting to the linear order provides:
\be \lb{UiLinOrderSol1}
\op{U}_I(t,t_0) = \identity - \ii \intdef{t_0}{t}{t'} e^{\ii \hnot t'} \hone{t'} e^{-\ii \hnot t'} \; .
\ee
So, at the first order in $\hone{}$ equation \eqref{ketTimeEvol1} can thus be written as:
\be \lb{ketTimeEvol2} 
\ket{\psi(t_{0},t)} = \left( \op{U}_0(t-t_0) - \ii \intdef{t_0}{t}{t'} \op{U}_0(t-t') \hone{t'} 
\op{U}_0(t'-t_0) \right)\ket{\psi_0} \; ,
\ee
were we have defined the time evolution operator of the unperturbed Hamiltonian by
\be
\op{U}_0(t-t_0)\equiv e^{-\ii \hnot(t -t_0)} \;.
\ee
The time evolution of left vectors can be derived in the same way. We can express the temporal evolution of the left 
vectors in the form:
\be \lb{braTimeEvol1}
\bra{\psi(t_{0},t)} = \bra{\psi_0} e^{-\ii \hnot t_0} \op{U}_{I}(t_0,t) e^{\ii \hnot t} \;,
\ee
plugging this equation in the conjugate Schroedinger equation and pursuing the same procedure defined above, we obtain the 
linear order expression of time evolution of left vectors:
\be\lb{leftVectTimeEvol2}
\bra{\psi(t_{0},t)} = \bra{\psi_0} \left( \op{U}_0(t_0-t) + \ii \intdef{t_0}{t}{t'} \op{U}_0(t_0-t') 
\hone{t'} \op{U}_0(t'-t) \right) 
\ee
It is immediate to check that, in order to preserve the norm vectors during the time evolution, it is sufficient that $\op{U}_I$ 
possesses the  semi-group structure $\op{U}_I(t_2,t_1) \op{U}_I(t_1,t_0) = \op{U}_I(t_2,t_0)$. An inspection of \eqref{UiLinOrderSol1}
evidences that this condition is satisfied in the linear response regime.

\section{Draft of the paper - old notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Aim of the paper: Compute the electronic properties of a molecular system with the formalism of linear scaling using a LR-TDDFT inside BigDFT code. 
%We also want to define a set of computational tools that allow to check the reliability of the computation.  
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Motivation: the DFT code have reached reliable features of precision for the computation of the GS. The same probletic are instead needed in order to achieve the same type of results for spectroscopic properties in large systems
\begin{itemize}
\item Quantify the impact of several modelling of a given systems (environment, disorder)
\item Systematic approach has proven its effectiveness for GS calculations (easy to handle)~\cite{deltatest2016}. The quality of localized basis function is therefore easy to quantify (variational theorem)
\item A challenge is represented by large scale computation for \emph{molecular} systems
\end{itemize}
\item State-of-the-art 
\begin{itemize}
\item localized basis set for representing the Hamiltonians (e.g. Fiesta (Blase, Olevano), FHI-Aims, GWMol)
\item This approach has been also generalized to LR calculation in the case of ONETEP \cite{Ratcliff2013}. However little is said about the reliability of the results in terms of the convergence of the spectra
\end{itemize}
\item Content of the paper: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Brief illustration of the support function approach in wavelets (Large systems are  accessible for the structure (Energy, Forces,\ldots)
\item We want to exploit the wavelet properties in the context of LR, \emph{by also providing some criteria} which may be of interest for the evaluation of the quality of the LR results.
\end{itemize}
\item Conclusions and implications
\begin{itemize}
\item We might apply this formalism also in the contect of MBPT and inspect the validity of the linear response functional for e.g. GW calcualtions (the perturbation operator will be different from the dipole)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
