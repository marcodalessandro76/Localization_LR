\begin{abstract}
We analyze how the fundamental equations which govern the linear response properties of a quantum system are influenced by the presence of open boundaries.
In particular we focus our attention on linear-response (LR)-TDDFT calculation of molecular systems. We show that optical excitations of energy below the LR ionization potential 
behave as observable, localized quantities, that can be computationally calculated with high precision, provided an adequate level of completeness.
Above this energy threshold, the analytic structure of the susceptibility functional might be separated in two sectors: one can still be described in terms of observable excitation 
with discrete energies, that can be captured within computational setups tailored for localized states. However such excitations are embedded in a continuum of excited states 
that, on the contrary, behave as plane waves and cannot be described efficiently by the same computational techniques. Such excitations do not exhibit observable features and 
\emph{cannot} be considered as poles of the dynamical polarizability. Nonetheless, the contribution of such continuum of excitation reveals to be of paramount importance even 
for expressing LR quantities in the infrared regime like for example static polarizability.
This is particularly evident for small molecules; we show how these considerations might be influenced by the size of molecular system.
We then present indicators that can help to quantify such potential observable property of an excitation, that can be evaluated 
in any discretization scheme.  This result is a inherent behavior of the system's Liouvillian, and does not depend on computational treatment of the 
unoccupied subspace.

\section{Introduction}
Since the days of their foundations, disciplines like Computational Physics or Quantum Chemistry always had to deal with the problem of the 
computational reliability of the results. More specifically, a computational result may be considered as reliable for various reasons.
It might be, for example, in agreement with some previously existing data that the employed computational model is susceptible to reproduce.
The model itself can in this way be classified as ``accurate''; it may then be employed to extract, \textit{in silico},
other quantities that might be then used to \emph{predict} or \emph{interpret} experimental data.
Another concept of reliability is the concept of  ``precision'', which is more focused to the actual results
that a given computational model provides for a specific set of quantities, regardless of their potential agreement with 
experimental data. The aim of precise computational approach is to reduce the \emph{computational} uncertanties
of quantities extracted out of a well-defined model, and provide reference results, to which other computer codes
employing the same model can be compared.

A recent, remarkable exemple of precision-driven initiative is provided by the DeltaCodes project~\cite{deltaTest2016},
where a grassroot community of code-owners struggled to extract well-defined computational results in the context of 
Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Ground-State quantum mechanical quantities as Lattice constants and bulk modulus of 
elementary crystals extracted from different codes were compared with each other, with the objective of reducing the uncertanties 
on such data, and in some sense, to define a \emph{calibration} procedure for a Solid-State Physics computer code. 
Any other code able to extract the same quantites with the same approximations might be compared with the 
results of the community in order to assess its computational reliability.

For a theoretical approach that is based on numerical calculations, for which no analytic reference solution exists, 
reducing the computational uncertainty is the only possible way to shed light on the predictivity power of the
model. In other terms, the ``accuracy'' of a result with respect to experimental data may be reliably quantified
only when the computational uncertainty is guaranteed to be significantly lower than the found discrepancy.
For communities like DFT, such a ``calibration'' of computer codes among each other is a discipline that is still in its infancy;
the DeltaCodes initiative and the foundations of DFT are separated in time by more than 50 years, and the computational
model employed in the comparison (the Perdew-Burke-Erzerhof functional~\cite{PBE}) has been introduced more than 20 years ago.

The problem is even more stringent for calculations that refer to quantities \emph{beyond} ground state, like
for instance the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) \cite{casida1995,runge1984,onida2002},
from which quantities like optical excitations or polarizability tensors
of a given system might be studied and put in relation with experimental data.
Here also, a plethora of computational approaches exist, that employ different numerical formalism and
basis sets, and it will be of great importance to identify quantities that can be ``measured'' in a given model, to assess
and quantify their computational uncertainty.

In this paper, we focus our attention to Linear-Response treatments of \emph{molecular} systems, 
in particular referring to LR-TDDFT calculation. We will investigate the impact that 
\emph{open} (i.e. Isolated) Boundary Conditions (BC) that have to be imposed to the system will have on the computational evaluation of LR quantites.
In order to do this, we perform analytic considerations on the equations beyond LR treatment.
Such considerations will enable us to distinguish quantities that \textit{a priori} can be compared among different treatments - and therefore tested for reproducibility - 
from others that would \emph{explicitly} depend of the the employed computational treatment. 
In particular, we will discuss the interplay between reproducible LR quantities and the \emph{locality} of the related objects.
% In order to do this, we perform analytic considerations on the equations beyond LR treatment,
% which will help us identifying how to distinguish -- \textit{a priori} -- quantities that are susceptible to be 
% compared among different treatments, as they are \emph{intrinsically} associated to localized objects,
% from quantities that \emph{explicitly} depend of the the employed computational treatment.

Our considerations will also reveal useful for the understanding of the \emph{analytic structure} of LR quantities like
the linear susceptibility of the system (i.e. the \emph{reducible} polarizability).
Altough we refer, as anticipated, to TDDFT models, such considerations might also be transposed to Many-Body Perturbation Theory
approaches, in the context Quasi-Particle equations.

% Moreover, wheareas for Ground-State calculations the quantities are relatively easy to identify and extract,
% TD-DFT and more generally, linear-response calculation present a further difficulty, which is the problem
% of \emph{numerical} convergence. In other terms, beyond ground state, 
% the absence of tools like the variational theorem imposes us to focus on \emph{well-defined} quantites,
% and to study the conditions under which numerical convergence of the results can be achieved.



% The subject of the present investigation concerns with the study of isolated molecular-like systems subjected to a time-dependent perturbation. % in the linear response regime.
% This problem can be tackled within the contest of the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) \cite{runge1984,onida2002}, that allows one to establish the time-dependent 
% Kohn-Sham (KS) equations which determine the evolution of the one-particle properties of the system with respect to time. 
% 
% We focus our attention to the linear response regime (LR) in which the theory can be conveniently expressed in the frequency domain and the time-dependent KS equation are reformulated 
% as a quantum Liouville equation for the response density operator. Different computational approaches have been developed in literature \cite{baroni2008,hubener2014,brabec2015}, principally 
% with the aim of producing efficient algorithms for the evaluation of the physical observables. These methods differ both for the procedure adopted to solve the Liouville equation 
% (explicit diagonalization, self-consistent Sternheimer equation, Lanczos chain-like procedure, etc.) and both for the choice of the basis set employed to perform the calculations. 
% Nonetheless, in all the cases one is a dealing with a finite basis set that, unavoidably, gives rise to a limited computational domain. 
% It is then meaningful to try to understand under 
% which extent the computational-induced truncation of the natural open boundaries condition could produce observable effects on the physical quantities computed in the LR. 
% 
% A preliminary understanding of this problem can be achieved thanks to the results reported in \cite{boffi2016}. The authors of this paper discuss the effects of a finite basis set on the 
% occupied and virtual orbitals of a molecular system and establish a clear correspondence between the orbital localization character, and the independence of its properties (\emph{e.g.} energy) 
% with respect to the basis set. It is shown that (localized) orbitals with a bound-state behavior in the long range constitute a genuine discrete set and a finite basis is 
% able to provide a reliable description of these states if the sampled domain contains their natural sizes. On the contrary, unbound (delocalized) orbitals form a continuum of states in the 
% true system with open boundaries. For these class of objects the presence of a finite computational domain has a deeper impact since introduces a fictitious discretization of the energy levels. 
% Furthermore, the energies of the unbound orbitals are not stable with respect to a change of the size of the computational domain and approach to zero as long as it is increased.  
% 
% In this paper we aim to reach a deeper understanding of the possible effects of a finite computational basis set on the LR regime in open systems. To achieve this task we try to
% reformulate the relation between localization properties and basis independence for the main actors of the LR formalism. We present a discussion based on a double level analysis. First, 
% we propose a localization argument directly based on the inspection of the response density operator. Then, we move to a deeper level and investigate the properties of the susceptibility 
% functional, which represents the fundamental object in the contest of the linear response. Pursuing this approach we are naturally led to investigate the localization properties of excitation 
% operators, that in turn emerge as the resonant channel of the spectral decomposition of the susceptibility. In this way we establish a direct relation between the concept of basis independence 
% and the analytic structure of the linear response susceptibility.

% First of all it is useful to discuss the property of the ground state under this perspective. 
% Indeed, it is well known that the stability of the ground state and the localized nature of a molecular-like system ensures that the KS description of occupied states is represented 
% by a discrete set of wave functions that approaches to zero far apart from a compact region around the system's atoms. This behavior indicates that a (finite) basis set will provide 
% a reliable description of the ground state properties if it is able to sample a computational domain which contains the natural sizes of the occupied orbitals \cite{boffi2016}.
% The same arguments cannot be rigidly extended to the case in which an external time-dependent field starts acting on the system. Indeed, the perturbation drives the system out 
% from the equilibrium and the electrons sample a wider region of the state space, that will contains orbitals of both negative (bound) and positive (unbound) energies. 

\section{Localization properties of the linear response actors in open systems}

Let us start our discussion by revisting the impact that the Isolated BC have on the 
solutions of the time-independent Schr\"odinger Equation.
We here present well-known concepts of elementary quantum mechanics, under a perspective that
will turn out to be very useful in the forthcoming considerations about linear-response quantities.

\subsection{Long range behavior of the eigenvalue solution of the Schroedinger equation}
\label{SEopenSystem}
Consider a (one-body) wavefunction $\ket{\psi}$ solution of the equation
$\op H\ket{\psi}=\eps\ket{\psi}$, where we split the Hamiltonian operator into the sum of
a kinetic $\op T$ and a potential $\op V \equiv \op H - \op T$ term.
In view of analysing the impact of the BC, it is instructive to transform 
the Schroedinger Equation in a \emph{scattering} problem, by writing
\be\lb{SEHelmholtz1}
\ket{\psi} = \op G_H(\eps)\ket{\op V\psi}\;,
\ee
where we have introduced the Green function of the Helmholtz operator $\op G_H(\eps) = (\eps-\op T)^{-1}$,
resolvent of the free-particle hamltonian $H_s \equiv \op T$.

When describing the Ground State of a molecule, we suppose that the potential operator, even if non-local,
is associated to real-space elements $\bra{\r} \op V \ket{\r'}$ that can be considered as nonzero only on a
bounded domain. In other terms, a molecule can be associated to a ``scatterer'' that has a \emph{finite} 
spatial extension; if a state $\ket{\psi}$ is localized, it will be the same for the ket $\ket{\op V \psi}$, though 
perhaps in a larger region.
For a computational treatment of the problem, this property is fundamental in the 
choice of the numerical treatment; we know that basis functions that are tailored to express asymptotically vanishing 
wavefunctions are better suited for the solution of the problem.

This fact is made apparent by the expression of 
the kernel of $\op G_H(\eps)$ in the coordinate representation. 
When dealing with Isolated BC, it is easy to see that the solution of Eq.~\eqref{SEHelmholtz1}
can be expressed by:
\be\lb{HelmholtzKernelDef1}
\bra{\r} \op G_H(\eps) \ket{\r'} = \frac{1}{4\pi} \begin{cases}
\frac{e^{-\alpha|\r - \r' |}}{|\r- \r' |} \;,\; & {\textrm for}\; \eps  < 0\; \\ 
\frac{e^{\ii \alpha |\r-\r' |}}{|\r-\r' |} \;, & {\textrm for} \; \eps \geq 0
\end{cases} \;,
\ee
where $\alpha = \sqrt{2|\eps|}$. 

From the above expressions we can see that, \emph{for molecular systems},
the value $\epsilon=0$
represents a \emph{threshold}~\footnote{The threshold value in general should correspond to asymptotic value of the potential at infinity.} 
energy that separates two different classes of solutions.
Negative-energy solutions are \emph{localized}, i.e. they exhibit bound-state behaviour far away from the scatterer.
These are \emph{bound} states and, by means of their normalizability, they are associated to \emph{discrete}, well-defined energies.
The bound states can be of course labelled by quantum numbers that are defined by the properties of the scatterer, namely the
symmetries of the potential $\op V$.
In a computational discretization of the Schroedinger equation, such states can be in principle expressed with arbitrary precision, 
provided that the numerical treatment offers the adequate level of completeness. 
Being discrete and well-identified, the bound-state energies are a property of the molecule and can be associated to \emph{observable}
quantities. The values of their energies can be compared among different treatments and it is in principle possible to
provide reference results on them.


On the other hand, positive energy solutions behave differently. 
Even though the potential is localized, their positive energy makes them behave 
as spherical waves and its convolution with the source term  gives raise to a delocalized wavefunction $\psi(\r)$ 
in the whole accessible space.
As they cannot be normalized they belong to the essential spectrum of the hamiltonian operator and form a \emph{continuum} of states.
Thanks to the Lippman-Schwinger relation of Eq.~\eqref{SEHelmholtz1} they can be put in bijection with the eigenstates of the 
free-particle hamiltonian $\op H_s$. We may say that their quantum numbers are determined by the Laplacian operator, 
regardless of the particular features of the potential.

It is easy to see from these concepts that a computational treatment that is tailored for the discretization of bound states
will not be effective for continuum states, due to the different long-range asymptotic behaviour - which in turn is a clear consequence of the 
BC of the problem. In a numerical treatment, states with $\epsilon > 0$ will have a value of their energy that will \emph{always}
depend on the computational setup.

A direct numerical evidence of this problem has been discussed in \cite{boffi2016}. The authors of this paper analyze the effects of a finite basis set on the 
occupied and virtual orbitals of a molecular system and establish a clear correspondence between the orbital localization character, and the independence of its properties (\emph{e.g.} energy) 
with respect to the basis set. It is shown that (localized) orbitals with a bound-state behavior in the long range constitute a genuine discrete set and a finite basis is 
able to provide a reliable description of these states if the sampled domain contains their natural sizes. On the contrary, unbound (delocalized) orbitals form a continuum of states in the 
true system with open boundaries. For these class of objects the presence of a finite computational domain has a deeper impact since introduces a fictitious discretization of the energy levels. 
Furthermore, the energies of the unbound orbitals are not stable with respect to a change of the size of the computational domain and approach to zero as long as it is increased.  


\subsection{Fluctuation states. A localization argument for the response density}
It is evident that the arguments presented in the above section have a limited interest for the study
of Ground State quantities of molecules. By definition, all these quantities can be expressed as a 
functional which \emph{entirely} depends on bound states. As an illustration it is sufficient to recall
the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem that states that the Ground-State (GS) energy is a functional of the GS
charge density $\dmnot$. For molecular systems that are electronically stable (i.e. no anionic or metastable configurations),
such quantity is localized, in the sense of the above section. Stated otherwise, 
\emph{there is no need to express efficiently any portion of the continuum spectrum} to have a reliable GS treatment of molecules.

Let us now inspect the case of LR calculations.
%Linear response can be effectively applied to the analysis of the electronic excitations in open systems.
In this framework one consider the unperturbed Hamiltonian $\hnot$ and assume that 
the GS density $\dmnot$ is accessible and expressed in a given computational treatment. 
The linear response formalism allows us to evaluate the modification of the expectation value of a generic observable induced by a 
time (or frequency)-dependent perturbing field $\op\Phi(\omega)$ acting on the system. 
This quantity, written in the frequency domain, can be expressed through the evaluation of the \emph{linear response functional}
\be\lb{LinearResponseFunctDef1}
\braket{\delta\op O}_\Phi(\omega) = \trace{\dm'_\Phi(\omega)\op O} \;,
\ee
where $\op O$ represents the observable\footnote{For a sake of concreteness, we are limiting our considerations to observables that do not explicitly depend on time} under inspection 
and we have introduced the \emph{response density operator} $\dm'_\Phi(\omega)$ that codifies the modification of $\dmnot$ induced by the perturbation $\op\Phi(\omega)$. 

%The main objective of this section is to investigate the structure of the building blocks needed to express the response density operator. In particular, we are interested in clarifying 
%the behavior of the main actors of the LR in the long range, \emph{i.e.} outside from the support domain of the potential. 




% As a preliminary step for the forthcoming discussion we present a simple argument that allows us to determine the asymptotic character of the eigenvalue solution of the Schroedinger equation (SE) 
% $\op H\ket{\psi}=\eps\ket{\psi}$. The main aims of this analysis, apart from reproducing the well known behavior of the wave functions, is to introduce some tools and setting up notations and 
% terminology that will we widely used in the rest of the paper. 
% 
% The argument proceeds by splitting the Hamiltonian as the sum of the kinetic $\op T$ and potential $\op V$ term. Since we are dealing with molecular-like systems $\op V$ has a compact support when 
% projected in the $\r$-representation. We can formally solve the SE as an inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation by writing
% \be\lb{SEHelmholtz1}
% \ket{\psi} = \op G_H(\eps)\ket{\op V\psi}\;,
% \ee
% where we have introduced the Green function of the Helmholtz operator $\op G_H(\eps) = (\eps-\op T)^{-1}$. We observe that, due to the properties of $\op V$, the \emph{source term} $\ket{\op V\psi}$ 
% of equation \eqref{SEHelmholtz1} is localized in space and, for open boundary conditions in three dimensions, the kernel of $\op G_H(\eps)$ in the coordinate representation reads: 
% \be\lb{HelmholtzKernelDef1}
% \bra{\r} \op G_H(\eps) \ket{\r'} = \frac{1}{4\pi} \begin{cases}
% \frac{e^{-\alpha|\r - \r' |}}{|\r- \r' |} \;,\; & {\textrm for}\; \eps  < 0\; \\ 
% \frac{e^{\ii \alpha |\r-\r' |}}{|\r-\r' |} \;, & {\textrm for} \; \eps \geq 0
% \end{cases} \;,
% \ee
% where $\alpha = \sqrt{2|\eps|}$. 
% This representation of the eigenvalues solution of the SE evidences that the value $\eps=0$ represents the threshold level that determines the asymptotic character of the wave functions. 
% Indeed, for $\eps > 0$,  $\op G_H(\eps)$ behaves as a spherical wave and its convolution with the source term  gives raise to a $\psi(\r)$ delocalized in the whole accessible space. Instead, 
% for values of $\eps < 0$, the kernel contains an exponential damping factor and the associated wave functions exhibit a bound-state behavior in the long range. Finally, we observe that the 
% square-integrability and the continuity of the wave function and its derivatives poses further constrains responsible for the discretization of the energy spectrum for bound-states.  
% 
% The different asymptotic behavior of the wave functions has a deep impact on the possible computational induced error obtained when this quantities are evaluated using a (finite) computational
% setup. 



\label{FluctuationState}

The response density operator is expressed as the first-order variation of $\dmnot=\sum_{\{p\}} \ket{\psi_p} \bra{\psi_p}$, where the set $\{\ket{\psi_p}\}$ denote the 
occupied states, \emph{i.e} the subset of the bound eigenstates\footnote{In what follows we will assume that the set of states $\{\ket{\psi_p}\}$ are described by real 
functions, when projected in the $\r$-representation.} of $\hnot$ with energy $\eps_p$ lower than the Fermi level. Using this notation we denote the energy of the HOMO level 
as $\eps_h$ and identify the value of the first ionization potential with $|\eps_h|$. 

In the contest of the LR the response density satisfies an equation of motion written in the form of a quantum Liouville operator (for example see \cite{baroni2008})
\be\lb{LiouvillianRhopomegaDef1}
\left(\omega - \Liouv\right) \dm'(\omega) =  \commutator{\op\Phi(\omega)}{\dmnot} \;,
\ee
where $\op\Phi(\omega)$ represents the perturbing field. 
The inspection of the linear order time evolution of the eigenstates of $\hnot$ evidence that the response density acts as a transition 
operator, linking the occupied and empty subspaces of $\hnot$, and satisfies the \emph{transverse} condition  
\be\lb{RhopTransverseDef1}
\dm' = \dm_{\perp} \doteq \dmnot\dm'\op Q_0 + \op Q_0\dm'\dmnot \;,
\ee
where $\op Q_0=\identity-\dmnot$ is the projector in the subspace orthogonal to the occupied states of $\hnot$. 
Due to this fact we can introduce an explicit representation of the 
response density parametrized as
\be\lb{rhoPrimeFluctuationStateDef1}
\dm'_\Phi(\omega) = \sum_p\left(\ketbra{\psi_p}{f_p^\Phi(-\omega)} + \ketbra{f_p^\Phi(\omega)}{\psi_p}\right) \;.
\ee
Here we have introduced the set of $\omega$-dependent \emph{fluctuation states} $\{\ket{f_p^\Phi(\omega)}\}$, 
that have values in the \emph{unoccupied} subspace of $\hnot$. 
An analysis of the Liouville equation \eqref{LiouvillianRhopomegaDef1} for the response density written in this fashion evidences that the equations of motion of fluctuation states are 
written as a modified Sternheimer equations \cite{mahan1980}
\be\lb{fluctuationStateEqMotion1}
\left[\omega - (\hnot-\eps_p)\right]\ket{f_p^\Phi(\omega)} = \op Q_0(\op\Phi(\omega)+\op V'[\dm'])\ket{\psi_p} \;,
\ee
and we observe that the first-order Hamiltonian contains, apart from the perturbing field, a further term $\op V'[\dm']$ due to the density-dependence of $\hnot$.

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[scale=0.56]{CO_alpha+D0_vsBoxSize.eps}
\caption{\label{co_alphaStatic}(Color online) Convergence of the statical polarizability of the $CO$ with respect to the size of the computational domain.}
\end{figure}

% The interesting aspect of these equations in the perspective of the present analysis is that they allow us to present a localization argument for the fluctuation states using a procedure  
% analogous to the one depicted in section \ref{SEopenSystem}. So we split the unperturbed Hamiltonian as the sum of the kinetic $\op T$ and potential $\op V$ term and express the solution of 
% \eqref{fluctuationStateEqMotion1} in the form of a self-consistent inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation
It is easy to see that the solution of equation \eqref{fluctuationStateEqMotion1} can be casted in the form of
a set of scattering problems:
%a self-consistent inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation
\be\lb{rhoPrimeFluctuationStateDef2}
\ket{f_p^\Phi(\omega)} = \op G_H(\omega+\epsilon_p)\ket{s_p^\Phi(\omega)} \;,
\ee
with:%here in this case the source term contains further addend apart from the unperturbed potential and reads:
\be
\ket{s_p^\Phi(\omega)} =  \op V\ket{f_p^\Phi(\omega)} + \op Q_0(\op V'(\omega) + \op \Phi(\omega))\ket{\psi_p} \;.\nn
\ee
As a stringent hypothesis, 
let us now assume that the operator $\op Q_0(\op V'(\omega) + \op \Phi(\omega))$ is, line $\op V$ nonzero on a bounded real-space domain.
%The localization character of fluctuation states can be assessed by following the same argument discussed in section \ref{SEopenSystem} for the eigenstates of the SE. In this case 
%the source term depends also from the perturbation added to the system so this analysis applies only to the class 
%of perturbing field for which $\ket{\op\Phi\psi_p}$ is localized, when projected
%in the $\r$-representation. 
It emerges that, for each choice of $p$, the value $\omega = |\eps_p|$ represents the threshold level that govern the localization properties of the corresponding 
fluctuation state. For $\omega > |\eps_p|$,  the Helmholtz kernel behaves as a spherical wave and  gives raise to a $f_p(\omega,\r)$ delocalized in the whole accessible space,
whereas for $\omega < |\eps_p|$ the kernel contains an exponential damping factor and $f_p(\omega,\r)$ exhibit a bound-state behavior in the long range.   

A direct confirmation of the localization character of fluctuation states at $\omega=0$ can be achieved through a ground-state calculation. Indeed, $\ket{f_p(\omega)}$ are nothing but the 
perturbed KS eigenstates projected out from the domain of $\dmnot$, so for a constant perturbation $\op\Phi_s$ it turns out that $\ket{f_p(0)} = \op Q_0\ket{\psi_p^{\Phi_s}}$. The perturbed KS 
states $\ket{\psi_p^{\Phi_s}}$ can be computed (beyond LR) by performing a DFT ground-state computation in which the constant perturbing field is added to the external potential and the 
spatial extension of the fluctuation states can be directly measured. 
The results of this procedure for a $CO$ molecule subjected to a static electric field are reported in figure \ref{co_alphaStatic}. The local character of the fluctuation states at $\omega=0$ is 
probed by verifying the convergence of the statical polarizability versus the size of the computational domain used to express the fluctuation states. The convergence rate is compared with the 
one of the static dipole of the molecule computed at zero external field. The plots evidence that the typical sizes of $\ket{f_p(0)}$ are analogous to the ones of the unperturbed KS orbitals. 

\emph{(Tweet)} The analysis described in this section has shown that the building blocks of the response density $\{\ket{f_p(\omega)}\}$ possess the same long-range properties of the bound KS
orbitals for $\omega < |\eps_p|$, while behave as unbound states for values of $\omega$ above the threshold levels. In the next section we will discuss the implication of the existence of these
two distinct regimes on the numerical convergence of the observables computed within the LR framework. Before doing this we propose an analogous analysis with the aim to understand the localization 
properties of the excitation-based description of the LR.


\subsection{Excitation operators. The analytic structure of the susceptibility functional}

The study of the localization properties of the LR functional, formerly discussed through the inspection of the response density operator, can be reformulated in terms of the 
\emph{susceptibility functional}, defined trough the operator equation  
\be\lb{SusceptibilityDef1}
\dm'(\omega) = \sop{{\cal \chi}}(\omega) \op\Phi(\omega) \;. 
\ee
This alternative formulation of the problem has the advantage of providing general information on the nature of the excitation spectrum. Results achieved in this way thus describes an intrinsic 
feature of the system under inspection and determine the properties of the LR independently from the specific choice of the perturbing field. 

The analysis is based on the spectral decomposition of the Liouville equation \eqref{LiouvillianRhopomegaDef1} and the make usage of the \emph{excitation operators}, defined through the 
left and right action eigenvalue equations 
\be\lb{ExcitationOperatorsDef1}
\Liouv \op E_a = \Omega_a \op E_a \qq \op{\tilde E}_a \Liouv = \Omega_a \op{\tilde E}_a \;,
\ee
together with the operator orthonormalization condition %$\trace{\op{\tilde E}\op E'} = \delta(E-E')$. 
\be\lb{orthoExcitatioOpDef1}
\trace{\op{\tilde E}_a\op E_b} = \delta_{ab} \;.
\ee
Excitations are transverse operators so that $\op E_a = \dmnot\op E_a\op Q_0 + \op Q_0\op E_a\dmnot$ and can be expressed through a dyadic representation as follows
\begin{align}\lb{ExcitationOperatorsDef2}
\op E_a &= \sum_p \left( \ket{\phi^a_p}\bra{\psi_p} + \ket{\psi_p} \bra{\chi^a_p}\right)\;, \nn \\
\op{\tilde E}_a = \commutator{\dmnot}{\op E^t_a} &= \sum_p \left( \ket{\psi_p}\bra{\phi^a_p} - \ket{\chi^a_p} \bra{\psi_p}\right)\;,
\end{align}
where we have defined the \emph{excited states} $\ket{\phi^a_p}$ and $\bra{\chi^a_p}$ that, by construction, are orthogonal to the occupied orbitals of $\hnot$. 
% We observe that right eigenvalues of $\Liouv$ can be written in terms of the left ones due to the properties of the Liouvillian described in appendix \ref{LiouvillianAction}. 
% The introduction of the excitation operators allows us to express the spectral decomposition of the resolvent of the Liouvillian so that:
% \be\lb{RhopExcitationDef1}
% \sop{{\cal \chi}}(\omega) \cdot   = \sum_{\{a\}} \op E_{a} \,
% \frac{\trace{\op E_a^t\cdot}}{\omega-\Omega_a} \;.
% \ee 
By applying equations \eqref{LiouZeroDef1},\eqref{CouplDef1} and \eqref{LiouvillianRightActionDef1} presented in appendix \ref{LiouvillianAction} to the dyadic representations of the excitation 
operators, it emerges that equations \eqref{ExcitationOperatorsDef1} can be recasted in the form of a Sternheimer-like equations for the excited states 
\begin{align}\lb{ExcitationOperatorsDef3}
&\left[\Omega_a-(\hnot - \eps_p)\right] \ket{\phi_p^a} = \op Q_0 \op V'[\op E_a] \ket{\psi_p} \;, \nn\\
&\left[-\Omega_a-(\hnot - \eps_p)\right]\ket{\chi_p^a} = \op Q_0\op V'[\op E^t_a]\ket{\psi_p}  \;, 
\end{align}
and the orthonormalization condition \eqref{orthoExcitatioOpDef1} implies 
\be\lb{ExcitedStateOrthNormDef1}
\sum_p \left(\brket{\phi_p^a}{\phi_p^b} - \brket{\chi_p^b}{\chi_p^a}\right) = \delta_{ab} \;. 
\ee
Once again we present a formal solution of \eqref{ExcitationOperatorsDef3} as follows 
\begin{align}
&\ket{\phi^a_p} = \op G_H(\Omega_a+\eps_p)\ket{s_{\phi}} \;, \nn \\
&\ket{\chi^a_p} = \op G_H(-\Omega_a+\eps_p)\ket{s_{\chi}} \;,
\end{align}
where the source terms $s_\phi$ and $s_{\chi}$ collect the sum of the r.h.s of \eqref{ExcitationOperatorsDef3} plus the action of the KS potential on the excited states. 

The excitation spectrum is symmetric w.r.t the inversion of the eigenvalues $\Omega_a \rightarrow -\Omega_a$ and we focus our analysis on the sector with positive energies. The localization 
character of $\op G_H(\Omega_a+\eps_p)$ depends from $\Omega_a$ and we identify the threshold level $\Omega_a=|\eps_p|$. At the same time we point out that the Helmholtz kernel evaluated in 
$-\Omega_a+\eps_p$ contains an exponential damping factor for \emph{all} the positive values of $\Omega_a$.  As a consequence of these behaviors and assuming the spatial localization of 
the source terms,  we observe that the asymptotic character of $\ket{\phi^a_p}$ changes from bound to unbound as the value of the excitation energy crosses the threshold $|\eps_p|$ while all 
the $\ket{\chi^a_p}$ states exhibit a bound-state behavior for all the values of $a$. 
Furthermore, excited states are subjected to the orthonormalization condition \eqref{ExcitedStateOrthNormDef1} that acts as a ulterior constraint and has the effect of determining the quantization 
of the energy levels associated to the the bound-state solutions. Thus we can conclude that all the states $\ket{\chi^a_p}$ and the $\ket{\phi^a_p}$ with $\Omega_a$ below the threshold value constitute 
a genuine \emph{discrete} set, while the ones in the unbound energy range behaves as generalized eigenvectors associated to a continuum spectrum.

The structure of the excitation spectrum follows from the properties of the excited states described above. To clarify this point we consider a value of $\Omega_a$ that satisfies equations
\eqref{ExcitationOperatorsDef1}. In correspondence of this values equations \eqref{ExcitationOperatorsDef3} possess a solution in which \emph{at least} one of the excited states 
is not zero. We denote with $p=p_m$ the label of the $\ket{\phi^a_p}$  with the highest value of $|\eps_p|$, among the ones that contribute to \eqref{ExcitationOperatorsDef2}. From the previous 
considerations it emerge that if $\Omega_a<|\eps_{p_m}|$ \emph{all} the excited states in the dyadic representation of the excitation operator possess a bound-state like behavior. Excitations 
of this type thus represent localized quantities and the associated eigenvalue are discrete. On the contrary, for $\Omega_a>|\eps_{p_m}|$ some (or all) of the excited states in the dyadic representation
of the excitation behave as generalized eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalue belong to a continuum of accessible values.

The typical structure of the excitations landscape is depicted in figure \ref{ExcitationLandscape}. The plot evidences that below the first ionization energy $|\eps_h|$ only localized excitations are 
present. Conversely, in the intermediate energy interval that extends from $|\eps_h|$ to the absolute value of the deepest occupied orbital, the elements belonging to the discrete sector are embedded 
in a continuum of delocalized excitations. Lastly, for energies higher than $|\eps_1|$ the excitations landscape takes contributions only from the delocalized sector. 

%The introduction of the excitation operators allows us to express the spectral decomposition of the resolvent of the Liouvillian so that:
%Susceptibility written as
The introduction of the excitation operators allows us to express the susceptibility functional \eqref{SusceptibilityDef1} through the spectral decomposition of the resolvent of the 
Liouvillian. Pursuing this procedure provides:
\be\lb{RhopExcitationDef2}
\sop{{\cal \chi}}(\omega) \cdot   = \left(\sum_a + \int\dd a   \right) \op W_{a} \,
\frac{2\trace{\op W_a \cdot}}{\omega^2-\Omega_a^2} \;,
\ee 
where we have defined the symmetric operators $\op W_a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ketbra{w_p^a}{\psi_p}+\ketbra{\psi_p}{w_p^a})$ and states $\ket{w_p^a}=\ket{\psi_p^a}+\ket{\chi_p^a}$.

On the basis of the present analysis we have explicitly separated the contributions of the discrete and continuous excitations in the spectral decomposition \eqref{RhopExcitationDef2}. 
The first sector is realized by the (finite) set of localized excitations with discrete eigenvalues that contribute as \emph{true poles} of the susceptibility. 
Instead, the second sector contains the dense set of delocalized excitations with an associated continuum spectrum. Excitations belonging to this sector thus lose their intrinsic physical meaning 
and have to be understood as a tool to express the spectral decomposition of the Liouvillian superoperator. 

% The elements of the first category correspond to \emph{true poles} of the susceptibility while the others can be interpreted only in terms of the spectral function. 

% This analysis has revealed that the excitations spectrum is composed by two distinct sectors. The first one is realized by the (finite) set of localized excitations with discrete eigenvalues. Extending 
% the results achieved in \cite{boffi2016} for the KS virtual orbitals, to the equations for excited states \eqref{ExcitationOperatorsDef3}, we conclude that localized excitations behave as 
% \emph{observable} quantities and the associated energies possess an absolute meaning, which should not depend from the computational setup used for their representation. 
% 
% Instead, the second sector contains the dense set of delocalized excitations with an associated continuum spectrum. These excitations behave as the unbound virtual orbitals analyzed in \cite{boffi2016} 
% and are deeply affected by the computational setup used to represent them. In particular, the presence of a finite computational domain implies a fictitious discretization of the excitation levels and 
% the associated spectrum exhibit an explicit dependence from the size of the domain. Excitations belonging to this sector thus lose their intrinsic physical meaning and have to be understood as a tool to 
% express the spectral decomposition of the Liouvillian superoperator. 



% Lastly, we establish a link between the fluctuation states and excitation operators based description of the LR. Indeed, thanks to the defining equation \eqref{SusceptibilityDef1} we can 
% easily express the excitations expansion of fluctuation states as follows 
% \be\lb{FluctuationStateExcitationDef1}
% \ket{f_p(\omega)}   =
% \left(\sum_E + \int\dd E   \right) 
% %\frac{\trace{\commutator{\dmnot}{\op{\tilde E}}\op\Phi(\omega)}}{\omega-E} \ket{\phi^E_p} \;. \nn
% \frac{t_\Phi(E)}{\omega-E} \ket{\phi^E_p} \;,
% \ee 
% with $t_\Phi(E)=\trace{\commutator{\dmnot}{\op{\tilde E}}\op\Phi(\omega)}$. 
% %This formula shows that, for each value of $\omega$, both the sectors of the excitations spectrum contribute to the fluctuation state. 
% Thanks to the analysis presented in section \ref{FluctuationState} we know that fluctuation states possess a localized behavior up to $\omega=|\eps_h|$, so we conclude that 
% below this energy threshold the continuum sector of the excitation spectrum is able to resum in a localized way.  


%Excitations behave as singularity of the susceptibility operator and their knowledge provides a deeper insight into the analytic structure of the linear response. 

%\subsection{Discrete poles and spectral function. Physical meaning of the excitation spectrum} %{Comments. Physical meaning of the excitation spectrum}

% The analysis discussed above has evidenced that there exists both localized and delocalized excitations. While the role of the former is quite unambigous 
% We can express the 
% \be\lb{FluctuationStateExcitationDef1}
% \ket{f_p(\omega)}   =
% \left(\sum_E + \int\dd E   \right) 
% %\frac{\trace{\commutator{\dmnot}{\op{\tilde E}}\op\Phi(\omega)}}{\omega-E} \ket{\phi^E_p} \;. \nn
% \frac{t_\Phi(E)}{\omega-E} \ket{\phi^E_p} \;,
% \ee 
% with $t_\Phi(E)=\trace{\commutator{\dmnot}{\op{\tilde E}}\op\Phi(\omega)}$.
% This relation clarifies the role of the excitations in the spectral decomposition. We know from the analysis of section \ref{FluctuationState} that fluctuation states are localized
% up to $\omega=|\eps_h|$. 

%\section{Quality indicator for the numerical convergence of the LR}   %{Criterion for a reliable sampling of the excitation operators}
\section{Criterion of computational reliability for the numerical convergence of the LR}

% From the theoretical analysis of the previous section we can made two statements:
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item Fluctuation states, which constitute the building blocks of the response density, have a bound state-like character up to $\omega=|\eps_h|$ and behave as unbound delocalized
%  wave functions for higher values of $\omega$. 
%  \item The excitation landscape is composed of two sectors with distinct properties. The elements of the first one behave as localized, observable quantities and contribute as discrete 
%  poles to the spectral decomposition of the susceptibility functional. The second sector contains a continuum of delocalized excitations which represents a tool to provide
%  an effective representation of the spectral function. 
% \end{itemize}
The topic to be discussed in this section is the following: on the basis of these statements can we define some indicator to evaluate the reliability of a linear response calculations? And, 
if so, up to which energy threshold can we assume that our computations do converge?

The first element of this discussion is the introduction of the computational basis, made of $n_\mu$ basis functions $\{\mu\}$, used to perform the DFT calculations subjacent to the LR analysis. 
The properties of the $\mu$-basis (state something about the systematic character the basis? comment on the finite dimension of the computational domain?) are chosen to ensure an unbiased description 
of the ground state properties of the system. 

FIRST QUESTION: The usage of the $\mu$-basis allows us to obtain a reliable evaluation of the perturbation induced modification of an observable? 
The answer of this question is based on the analysis of equation \eqref{LinearResponseFunctDef2} and has been partially provided in section \ref{FluctuationState} (move that material in this section?). 
We can complete the answer by observing that $\ket{f_p(0)}$ can be obtained through a ground state calculation with the explicit time independent perturbation added to the system. So we can perform
a check on the goodness of the basis in this case as in a ground state calculation. Then use the localization argument of the fluctuation states to extend the reliability of the result up to
$\omega=|\eps_p|$. 

SO TO SUMMARIZE: below the threshold the numerical convergence is regulated by the localization of the fluctuation states, in this range we can assess the reliability of the results provided by
the $\mu$-basis by looking at the basis-independence of the fluctuation states at $\omega=0$. Above the threshold the convergence can be reached due to the localized nature of $\bra{\psi_p}\op O$, 
in this case the computational setup provides reliable results if it guarantees the unbiased reconstruction of fluctuation states in the support of $\bra{\psi_p}\op O$. In this range there is no a 
priori indicator of the goodness of the results. 

\subsection{Strong and weak convergence}

The localization properties of fluctuation states allows us to assess the reliability of the linear response functional computed using the given basis set. Indeed, writing the response 
density in terms of fluctuation states implies that 
\be\lb{LinearResponseFunctDef2}
\braket{\delta\op O}(\omega) = 2\sum_p \bra{\psi_p}\op O\ket{f_p(\omega)} \;,
\ee
so the computation of the linear response functional passes through the evaluation of the scalar products indicated in \eqref{LinearResponseFunctDef2}. We observe that there exists two 
distinct regimes, on the basis of value of $\omega$. The first one, which we will refer to as the \emph{below threshold regime}, is realized when $\omega$ is lower than the ionization 
potential $|\eps_h|$. In this case all the fluctuation states are below their threshold level and equation \eqref{LinearResponseFunctDef2} is expressed in terms of genuinely localized 
quantities\footnote{This consideration holds for the class of observables for which $\bra{\psi_p}\op O$ is a localized state  with bound-state behavior in the long range}, each of which 
possesses a physical cut-off radius. Due to this behavior we can affirm that given basis provides a reliable evaluation of \eqref{LinearResponseFunctDef2} if the chosen computational domain 
is suitable to express the bound-state like fluctuation states, in a analogous fashion of a ground state calculation. 

On the contrary, the computation of the linear response functional can be much more demanding in the \emph{above threshold regime}, realized for $\omega>|\eps_h|$, in which fluctuation 
states start behaving as unbound wave functions. In this case a computational description of fluctuation states is only meaningful in weak sense, \emph{i.e} inside the scalar products of 
\eqref{LinearResponseFunctDef2}, where the bound state character of $\{\bra{\psi_p}\op O\}$ behave as a regulator. This observation indicates that, above threshold, a computational setup 
provides a reliable assessment of \eqref{LinearResponseFunctDef2} only if it is able to express an unbiased description of the fluctuation states in the support of $\{\bra{\psi_p}\op O\}$. 

As an explicit example in support of these arguments we compare the absorption spectrum of a $CO$ molecule computed in three distinct real-space basis set, which differs for the dimension of 
the computational domain. Results reported in figure \ref{co_spectrum} evidences that the curves are almost coincident in the below threshold regime, whereas the effect of the computational 
setup are clearly visible for values of $\omega$ that exceed the threshold value. 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.56]{co_spectrum.eps}
\caption{\label{co_spectrum}(Color online) Convergence below threshold of the $CO$ spectrum computed in different computational setup.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Stability and convergence of the excitation spectrum}

This analysis reveals that the excitations spectrum is composed by two distinct sectors. The first one is realized by the (finite) set of localized excitations with discrete eigenvalues. Extending 
the results achieved in \cite{boffi2016} for the KS virtual orbitals, to the equations for excited states \eqref{ExcitationOperatorsDef3}, we conclude that localized excitations behave as 
\emph{observable} quantities and the associated energies possess an absolute meaning, which should not depend from the computational setup used for their representation. 

Instead, the second sector contains the dense set of delocalized excitations with an associated continuum spectrum. These excitations behave as the unbound virtual orbitals analyzed in \cite{boffi2016} 
and are deeply affected by the computational setup used to represent them. In particular, the presence of a finite computational domain implies a fictitious discretization of the excitation levels and 
the associated spectrum exhibit an explicit dependence from the size of the domain. Excitations belonging to this sector thus lose their intrinsic physical meaning and have to be understood as a tool to 
express the spectral decomposition of the Liouvillian superoperator.

\subsection{Fluctuation state and excitations}

Express the fluctuation state in terms of excitation using the relation $\ket{f_p(\omega)} = \dm'(\omega)\ket{\psi_p}$ and using formula \eqref{SusceptibilityDef1} to express the excitation
expansion of the response density. Due to this procedure we obtain
\be\lb{FSExcitationDef1}
\ket{f_p(\omega)}   = \left(\sum_a + \int\dd a   \right) \ket{w_p^a} \,
\frac{\bra{\psi_p}\op\Phi(\omega)\ket{w_p^a}}{\omega^2-\Omega_a^2} \;,
\ee 
with $\ket{w_p^a}=\ket{\phi_p^a}+\ket{\chi_p^a}$. 
Show the convergence of the statical polarizability of the $CO$ in function of the number of excitations. Write formula
\be\lb{AlphaExcitationDef1}
\alpha_{xx} =  \left(\sum_a + \int\dd a   \right) 2 \,
\frac{\left[\trace{\op W_a \op X}\right]^2}{\Omega_a^2} \;,
\ee 
and add the plot that show the convergence rate of the statical polarizability to the reference (finite difference) value in functions of the number of excitations. The plot evidence that the
continuum sector of the excitation spectrum is 
\begin{figure}

\caption{\label{co_AlphaExc}(Color online) Convergence of the statical polarizability of the $CO$ molecule w.r.t the number of excitations.}
\end{figure}

% \subsection{Choice of the $\alpha$-basis. Statical polarizability-driven criterion revised}
% 
% The previous considerations regard the relation between the localization properties of the fluctuation states and the possibility of having a quality indicator for the goodness of the $\mu$-basis. 
% Now we aim to extend/reformulate the question of the numerical convergence to the case in which the excitation-based representation of the LR is adopted.
% 
% The construction of the excitation operators requires the explicit sampling of the empty state subspace. We introduce the notion of \emph{$\{\alpha\}$-basis}: choose the empty eigenstates of the KS 
% Hamiltonian as a basis-set to express the excited state $\ket{\phi^E_p},\bra{\tilde\chi^E_p}$ and their duals. Excitations are written in the basis of transitions.  
% 
% COMMENT: The elements of the $\{\alpha\}$-basis are written in the (finite dimensional) $\{\mu\}$-basis. It follows that the $\{\alpha\}$-basis is finite dimensional too and has $n_\mu-n_{occ}$ degrees
% of freedom. Excitation index becomes discrete and the basis provide a partial sampling of the continuum sector of the excitation landscape.    


\section{Comments and conclusions}

The analysis carried out starting from the representation of the linear response functional in terms of fluctuation states has evidenced some general properties of the linear response
for open systems. In particular, by analyzing the asymptotic behavior of fluctuation states in long range limit, we have showed that they exhibit a bound-state character in the regime  
$\omega<|\eps_h|$. Consequently we have argued that the linear response functional, in the same $\omega$ range, provides a setup-independent result with a modest computational effort... 

This analysis has revealed that the excitations spectrum is composed by two distinct sectors. The first one is realized by the (finite) set of localized excitations with discrete eigenvalues. Extending 
the results achieved in \cite{boffi2016} for the KS virtual orbitals, to the equations for excited states \eqref{ExcitationOperatorsDef3}, we conclude that localized excitations behave as 
\emph{observable} quantities and the associated energies possess an absolute meaning, which should not depend from the computational setup used for their representation. 

Instead, the second sector contains the dense set of delocalized excitations with an associated continuum spectrum. These excitations behave as the unbound virtual orbitals analyzed in \cite{boffi2016} 
and are deeply affected by the computational setup used to represent them. In particular, the presence of a finite computational domain implies a fictitious discretization of the excitation levels and 
the associated spectrum exhibit an explicit dependence from the size of the domain. Excitations belonging to this sector thus lose their intrinsic physical meaning and have to be understood as a tool to

\appendix
\section{Left and right action of the Liouvillian superoperator}\lb{LiouvillianAction}

The Liouvillian superoperator $\Liouv$ for self-consistent systems is expressed as the sum of the unperturbed part plus a coupling term. The left action of these 
terms reads, respectively
\be\lb{LiouZeroDef1}
\Liouvnot \op O = \commutator{\hnot}{O} \;,
\ee
and
\be\lb{CouplDef1}
\coupl\op O = \commutator{\op V'[\op O]}{\dmnot}  = \op Q_0\op V'[\op O]\dmnot - \dmnot\op V'[\op O]\op Q_0 \;,
\ee
where $\op V'$ expresses the perturbation induced by the density dependence on ground state Hamiltonian and can be conveniently expressed by defining the 
\emph{scalar coupling kernel}
\be
U\left[\op O; \op O'\right] \equiv  \int \dd \r \dd \r' \trace{\op O \frac{\delta \hnot }{\delta \rho_0(\r,\r')}
} \trace{\op O' \ket{\r} \bra{\r'}} \;, \nn
\ee
on the basis of which
\be\lb{VpDef1}
\op V'[\op O]= 
\int \dd \r \dd \r' U\left[\ketbra{\r}{\r'};\op O\right] \ketbra{\r'}{\r}\;.
\ee
In view of building the spectral decomposition we are interested in finding both the left and right eigenstates of $\Liouv$.   
The right action of $\Liouv$ can be assessed through the equivalence $\trace{\op O'(\Liouv\op O)} = \trace{(\op O'\Liouv)\op O}$, so that:
\be
\op O\Liouv = -\commutator{\hnot}{\op O} + \int \dd\r\dd\r'
U\left[\commutator{\dmnot}{\op O};\ketbra{\r'}{\r}\right]\ketbra{\r}{\r'} \;. \nn
\ee
In the cases relevant for the present analysis the coupling kernel is symmetric with respect to the exchange of its arguments so also the right action of the 
Liouvillian is expressed in terms of $\op V'$, as follows
\begin{align}\lb{LiouvillianRightActionDef1}
\op O\Liouv &= -\commutator{\hnot}{\op O} + V'\left[\commutator{{\dmnot}}{\op O}\right] = -\commutator{\hnot}{\op O} + \nn \\ 
&+ \dmnot\op V'\left[\commutator{{\dmnot}}{\op O}\right]\op Q_0 + \op Q_0\op V'\left[\commutator{\dmnot}{\op O}\right]\dmnot \;.
\end{align}
In the last equivalence we have made usage of the transverse property (see equation \eqref{RhopTransverseDef1}) of the coupling superoperator. Formula 
\eqref{LiouZeroDef1},\eqref{CouplDef1} and \eqref{LiouvillianRightActionDef1} are the starting point for the solution of the eigenvalues equations \eqref{ExcitationOperatorsDef1}.
