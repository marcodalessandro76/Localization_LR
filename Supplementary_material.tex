\section*{Supplementary material}

We report the results of the excitation landscape for the $C_{60}$ and the Aflatoxin molecules. This analysis allows us to investigate the multi-threshold structure for systems with larger number of atoms and/or lower degrees of symmetry respect to the ones presented in the main text. The plots of Fig. \ref{exc-land} evidence that, in both the cases, the sector of localized excitations is very rich and extends well above the first ionization potential of the molecule. These results provide a further confirmation of the behavior already observed in the Table I. 

The growth of the localized sector with the number of atoms of the molecule seems to be a general feature. It can simply explained by observing that bigger molecules behave as wider potential wells and possess a high number of localized Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals that span a wide energy range. In a simplified two-levels picture, in which $\op V'=0$, the KS empty orbitals $\psi_a$ coincide with the excitation modes defined in eq. (17) and the associated energy is parametrized as $\Omega_a=\epsilon_a-\epsilon_p$. In this case to the increase of the energy range spanned by the localized orbitals it directly corresponds a richer sector of localized excitations.
When $\op V'$ is switched on the excitation modes are expressed as a combination of KS orbitals but the presence of a high number of localized orbitals allows for a rich sector of localized excitations, as confirmed by the results of Fig. \ref{exc-land}.
