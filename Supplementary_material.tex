\section*{Supplementary material}

We have investigated how the multi-threshold structure of the localized excitations might be put in relation with respect to
the number of atoms and/or the symmetry of the molecule. To this end, we have considered two case-studies, the carbon Fullerene, a highly symmetric structure made of 60 atoms, and the B1 Aflatoxin, depicted in Fig.~\ref{aflab1}, which has 35 atoms in a low-symmetric configuration.

The plots of Fig. \ref{exc-land} evidence that, in both cases, the sector of localized excitations is very rich and extends well above the first ionization potential of the molecule. These results provide a further confirmation of the behavior already observed in Table I.

It may be noticed that the number of localized excitations, either below or above the first ionization potentials is much higher than
the one of Fig.~5 of the paper, in the case of the Benzene molecule. This holds also for the low-symmetry aflatoxin molecule.

The growth of the localized sector with the number of atoms of the molecule seems thus to be a general feature.
A simple interpretation of this fact may be provided by considering perturbatively the coupling term $\op V'=0$ in Eq.~19 of the paper.
Indeed, larger molecules behave possess a high number of localized Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals that span a wide energy range.
A numerical evidence in support of this argument is presented in Fig. \ref{dos}, where the DOS of the KS (bound) orbitals of the Aflatoxin and $CO$ molecules are directly compared.
In a simplified two-levels picture, in which $\op V'=0$, the KS empty orbitals $\psi_a$ coincide with the excitation modes defined in eq. (17) and the associated energy is parametrized as $\Omega_a=\epsilon_a-\epsilon_p$. In this case to the increase of the energy range spanned by the localized orbitals it directly corresponds a richer sector of localized excitations.
When $\op V'$ is switched on the excitation modes are expressed as a combination of KS orbitals but the presence of a high number of localized orbitals allows for a rich sector of localized excitations, as confirmed by the results of Fig. \ref{exc-land}.
