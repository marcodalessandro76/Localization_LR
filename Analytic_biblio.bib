abstract="This chapter is devoted to exact conditions in time-dependent density functional theory. Many conditions have been derived for the exact ground-state density functional, and several have played crucial roles in the construction of popular approximations. We believe that the reliability of the most fundamental approximation of any density functional theory, the local density approximation (LDA), is due to the exact conditions that it satisfies. Improved approximations should satisfy at least those conditions that LDA satisfies, plus others. (Which others is part of the art of functional approximation).",
